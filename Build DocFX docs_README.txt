How to update documentation site and publish on Github pages

1. This command builds the site located in C:\Dev\HexMerlin\Automata\docs\_site
Start terminal in Visual Studio and run the following command from the path below:
C:\Dev\HexMerlin\Automata>docfx docs/docfx.json --serve

Comment: --serve can be omitted if you don't need to inspect the site locally first

2. The main landing page (index.html) is generated from this file:

C:\Dev\HexMerlin\Automata\docs\index.md

3. This entire folder can be deleted and regenerated by running the command in step 1:

C:\Dev\HexMerlin\Automata\docs\_site

4. To publish the site on Github pages, commit the changes to the master branch and push to the remote repository on Github.
